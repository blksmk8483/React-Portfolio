# React-Portfolio
A portfolio for Brandon Knight using React.

![Portfolio](Assets/Portfolio.gif)

## Description
I created a Portfolio page using REACT. You can click on the Homepage, About, Contact, Portfolio, and Resume pages. As well, you will find links to external pages (LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, and Twitter). This is my first experience with React and I enjoyed taking my time with this final challenge and learning more about react and styling with animations.

## Future Developments

- Adding more projects to the portfolio page.
- Link the contact page to an external site so it functions properly. This is a next week goal (12-13 - 12-17).
- Update the portfolio page to an external database so I do not have to hardcode each project in (12-13 - 12-17).
- I will come back to this project next week to make it more mobile friendly (12-13 - 12-17). 
- Also, I am aware the photos are no longer loading. For time sake I am turning it in and will correct this soon (12-13 - 12-17).
